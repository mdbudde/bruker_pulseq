Wishlist/comments for pulseq developers:

Add additional tags for shapes:
shape_label char  ; to identify shapes for basic knowledge, sinc, gauss, tanh, etc...
shape_type char   ; to identify and/or influence interpreter, rfmag, rfphase, grad, rfmagphase, ... it is highly unlikely the same shape will be used for multiple purposes.


Designate type of RF pulse:
excitation, refocus, inversion, etc... ; to help write the correct file for Bruker/Paravision, which constrains pulses based on their utility (excite<=90; refocus<=180; inversion=any)
rfmag and rfphase within stored shape  ; permit the pulse mag and phase data to be included in a single MAG PHASE line instead of separate shapes; possible add shape_type rfmagphase to inform the reading of such data.


Definitions:
Name char  ; give the seq file an identifier for the user: gre_v1.1, mprage_5-10-25, etc ...
Possibly other metadata, make it ignored if not included (optional)


Gradient and timing constraints:
Currently, blocks are permitted to have delays that do not match the duration of the gradients within the block. 
Why not constrain the blocks to ensure the gradients and durations match?
The Bruker/Paravision interpreter will have to
