Wishlist/comments for pulseq developers:

EASY:
Definitions:
Name char  ; give the seq file an identifier for the user: gre_v1.1, mprage_5-10-25, etc ...
Possibly other metadata (creation information: date, time, user, etc). ignore if not included (optional)

Add additional tags for shapes:
shape_label char  ; to identify shapes for basic user knowledge and metadata: sinc, gauss, tanh, smsR2, etc...
shape_type char   ; to identify and/or guide interpreter, rfmag, rfphase, rfmagphase, grad, gradxyz,  ... it is highly unlikely the same shape will be used for multiple purposes.

Designate type of RF pulse:
excitation, refocus, inversion, etc... ; to help write the correct file for Bruker/Paravision, which constrains pulses based on their utility (excite<=90; refocus<=180; inversion=180)
rfmagphase: rfmag and rfphase within single shape  ; permit the pulse mag and phase data to be included in a single MAG PHASE line instead of separate shapes

Gradients:
grad or gradxyz ; to define a single-channel gradient or a 3-column array of simultaneous x, y, z combination (useful for shaped gradient waveforms)



COMPLICATED:
Gradient and timing constraints:
Currently, blocks are permitted to have delays that do not match the duration of the gradients within the block. 
Why not constrain the blocks to ensure the gradients and durations match?
The Bruker/Paravision interpreter will have to deconstruct gradient durations and timings into shaped arrays.
